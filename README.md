# DevOps Show & Tell Project
## Example Scenario
### Problem Statement
A bike rental company wants to develop an application that allows customers to rent bikes remotely. The application requirements:
- user interface to get customer's personal info, location, the number of bikes
- display a rental confirmation and the price of the rental

Other considerations:
- Would like to deploy as soon as possible
- Make improvements to application along the way:
  - better website design (.css, .js)
  - machine learning to adjust prices based on demand
  - other functionalities...

### Files in this Repo:
- cicd.yml (CI/CD workflow)
- index.html (main user interface page)
- confirmation.html (bike rental confirmation page)
- app.py (backend code)
- model.pkl (machine learning model)
- data.csv (data for testing ML model)
